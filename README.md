## Introduction
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application
To run the FastAPI application locally, use the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
